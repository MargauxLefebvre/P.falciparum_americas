# Summary

## Creating the data set

-   Primary filters for the data from *P. falciparum* Community Project
    conducted by MalariaGen
-   Mapping and calling for the added data (Brazil, Haiti and French
    Guiana)
-   Merge & final filters for the whole dataset
-   LD-pruning, MAF filtering for some analysis
-   *Plasmodium praefalciparum* as an outgroup

## Population structure analysis

-   PCA
-   ADMIXTURE
-   TreeMix
-   ADMIXTOOLS2

## Population genetic diversity and demographic history

-   $\pi$ and Tajimaâ€™s *D*
-   Stairway Plot 2

## Selection scan

-   Rsb and XP-EHH
-   ABS

## Detection of introgression

-   RND
-   Haplotype networks
